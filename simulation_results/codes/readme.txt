There are three types of simulation code in this project.

The main ones (that generated all the results) are plotting_code and direct_energy_consumption.
direct_energy_consumption generates results with both the option of direct energy consumption and renewable energy.

plotting_code generates all the figures.

simulation_code is an older version of the code that serves as backup.
It only has renewable energy option and does not implement direct energy consumption.
