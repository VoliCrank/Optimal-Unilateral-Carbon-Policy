This folder contains output results from our simulation code.

direct_consumption_opt and direct_consumption_higheps_opt are results from the optimal unilateral policy,
with foreign elasiticity of extraction equal to 0.5 and 2 respectively.

direct_consumption_constrained and direct_consumption_higheps_constrained are results for the constrained policies.

direct_consumption_global is the result for when the planner can control everything Home and Foreign.
We assume 0.5 elasticity of extraction only in the case of the global planner (as if everything is Home).

direct_consumption_renewable is the result for renewable energy simulations, there is no high Foreign elasticity comparison in this case.

output_case3 and output_case3_D_2 are results for a previous version of the paper (with no direct energy consumption).
