files in this folder are raw data for which we calibrate our baseline values to.

All simulations in OUCP use baselinecarbon_direct_2018.xlsx.
The values are obtained from IEA and OECD database which include energy consumed directly.
The previous versions of the paper used BaselineCarbon_2015 which does not contain direct consumption of energy.

The file energy_extraction_calculation.xlsx contains calculations of world energy extraction which include getting
raw values from IEA, applying emission factors and scaling to world consumption values.

All the other files are deprecated and not used in the code.
